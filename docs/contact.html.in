        This is a high volume mailing list.  It is a place for discussions
        about the <strong>development</strong> of libvirt-php but it is <strong>not</strong> only for libvirt-php
        since it's mainly for libvirt itself so please be so kind and include <strong>[libvirt-php]</strong> prefix
        to your e-mail to address libvirt-php.
      </dd>

        <ul>
          <li>New features for libvirt-php</li>

      Please note, libvirt-php no longer accepts patches sent via mailing lists
      as it uses <a href="https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt-php/-/merge_requests">merge requests</a>.
      It also uses gitlab's <a href="https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt-php/-/issues">issue tracker</a>.
